				Without limiting other remedies, we may issue warnings, limit or terminate our service, remove hosted content and take technical and legal steps to keep users off laisa if we think that they are creating problems or acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of our policies.

By using laisa, you agree that your ads can be displayed on these other sites.

If the service you use incurs a fee, you'll be able to review and accept terms that will be clearly disclosed at the time you post your ad. Our fees are quoted in South African Rand, and we may change them from time to time. We'll notify you of changes to our fee policy by posting such changes on the site. We may choose to temporarily change our fees for promotional events or new services; these changes are effective when we announce the promotional event or new service.
			</p>

			<p>
				Our fees are non-refundable, and you are responsible for paying them when they're due. If you don't, we may limit your ability to use the services. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other permissible collection mechanisms.

			<p>
				<span id="strong_terms">Content.</span> laisa contains content from us, you, and other users. laisa is protected by copyright laws and international treaties.

			<p>
				When providing us with content or causing content to be posted using our Services, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable (through multiple tiers) licence to exercise any and all copyright, publicity, trademark, and database rights and other intellectual property rights you have in the content, in any media known now or developed in the future.

			<p>
				<span id="strong_terms">Infringement.</span> Do not post content that infringes the rights of third parties, This includes, but is not limited to, content that infringes on intellectual property rights such as copyright and trademark (e.g. offering counterfeit items for sale). A large number of very varied products are offered on laisa by private individuals in South Africa. Entitled parties, in particular the owners of copyright, trademark rights or other rights owned by third parties can report any offers which many infringe on their rights, and submit a request for this offer to be removed. If a legal representative of the entitled party reports this to us in the correct manner, products infringing on the intellectual property rights will be removed by laisa.
			</p>
				
			<p><span id="strong_terms">Reporting an infringement:</span></p>
			
			<p>
				In order to participate in the Notice of Infringement Programme, you only need to complete a Notice of Infringement Form and fax it to laisa. You can use this form, complete with your signature, to report advertisements which may infringe on your property rights. The information requested in the Notice of Infringement Form is for the purpose of ensuring that the parties reporting these objects are either the entitled party or their officially authorized representative. This information must also enable laisa to identify the advertisement to be removed. Once we have received your correctly completed Notice of Infringement Form, you can simply send later reports to laisa via the e-mail address provided.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note: This form can only be used by the lawful owners of the intellectual property rights. "Notice of Infringement" is intended to ensure that products offered do not infringe the copyright, trademark right or other intellectual 	property rights of third parties.
			</p>
			<p>
				For all other questions, visitors and advertisers can get Help by using this knowledge base or opening a Case.
			</p>

				<span id="strong_terms">Liability.</span> You agree not to hold us responsible for things other users post or do.
			</p>

			<p>
				We do not review users' postings and are not involved in the actual transactions between users. As most of the content on laisa comes from other users, we do not guarantee the accuracy of postings or user communications or the quality, safety, or legality of what's offered.
			</p>

			<p>
				In no event do we accept liability of any description for the posting of any unlawful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene or indecent information, or material of any kind which violates or infringes upon the rights of any other person, including without limitation any transmissions constituting or encouraging conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable law.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you.
			</p>

			<p>
				Despite the previous paragraph, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or any third party (whether in contract, delict, negligence, strict liability in delict, by statute or otherwise) is limited to the greater of (a) the total fees you pay to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to liability, and (b) 100 South African Rand.
			</p>

			<p>
				Nothing in these terms shall limit our liability for fraudulent misrepresentation, for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence or the negligence of our agents or employees.

				If a dispute arises between you and laisa, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution by going to the laisa Help page. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation.

				<h3>Important Information</h3>
			
				<span id="strong_terms">Social login</span>
				<br>When you use social login:
				<br>•    If you sign into your social network account using the same email that you previously used to register for an account with us, you will access your existing account with us. 
				<br>•    If you sign into your social network account using an email address that we don’t recognise in our systems, a new account will be created in our systems for you. 

				<br><br>You may use social login or regular sign in each time you login into your account with us. If you use regular sign in but a password has not been issued to you (because you registered through social login) you need to get a password through the password reset flow.

				<br><br>When you use social login the "keep me signed in" policies of the social network provider apply. We do not control those policies. For your safety we recommend that you: 
				<br>•    Don’t use social login if you are accessing our Services using a public or shared device
				<br>•    Visit your social network provider site to learn about their sign in policies and your options

				<br><br><span id="strong_terms">Unwanted or threatening email</span>
				<br>We do not tolerate abuse of our Services. You do not have permission to add other users to your mailing list, call or send SMS messages for commercial purposes, even if a user bought something from you, unless the user has given their explicit consent. Sending unwanted or threatening email and SMS messages is against our Terms of Use. To report spam or spoof emails please contact Customer Service.
				
				<br><br><span id="strong_terms">Third party privacy practices</span>
				<br>This Privacy Notice addresses only the use and disclosure of personal information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, or if you are directed to a third party website, their privacy notices and practices will apply.

				<br><br>We can’t guarantee the privacy or security of your information once you provide it to a third party. You should check the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information, even when dealing with buyers or sellers on our site.<br><br>

			<p>
				When this happens your ad may be temporarily suspended (this depends on a few things) until we look at it. We check reported ads as quickly as we can. As long as we find that it hasn't broken any Posting Policies (What are the General posting rules?) or laisa Terms of Use it should be back up again shortly.
